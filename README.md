# Description

This is a game that has many implementations. For the Arduboy, there is, for example https://github.com/akkera102/03_tiny_2048.

My objective with this game is to learn 

* Arduboy programming
* Some C++
* The Model-View-Controller framework.

# Installation

1. In a terminal, navigate to the Sketchbook folder. This is usually in `$HOME/Arduino` or `$HOME/Documents/Arduino`. The exact location can be found in the Arduino IDE: Menu File
&#x2192;Preferences... .
2. Execute `git clone git@github.com:awisse/2048-Arduboy.git`.
